          <h1>KickStarter Crowdfunding Recommendation Enginer</h1>
        </div>

        <h2 style="margin: 14px 0px 0px 45px;">Idea</h2>
        <p> Kickstarter is one of the most popular crowdfunding platform on the internet. The aim of
            this project is to predict the success or failure of a Kickstarter campaign at launch time.</p>
        
        <hr>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p> Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary
            contributions from many people. The majority of todayâ€™s crowdfunding happens online
            through various websites and one of the most prominent is Kickstarter. The steps to start
            a Kickstarter project are; start a campaign, set the minimum funding goal, set reward
            levels, and choose a deadline. The most important aspect to know about launching a
            Kickstarter project is that if the project falls short of meeting its minimum funding goal,
            the project will not receive any fund. The projects analyzed in this project fall into one of
            14 categories (Art, Comics, Dance, Design, Fashion, Film & Video, Film & amp; Video,
            Food, Games, Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology, Theater) and 51
            subcategories. Only 55% of campaigns reach their funding goal thus it is extremely
            important for creators to know the factor(s) that might impact the outcome of their
            project before launch.
        </p>
        <p> This project will take inputs from users using website and machine learning algorithms
            will provide various prediction / recommendations which are helpful to conduct the
            crowdfunding project.
