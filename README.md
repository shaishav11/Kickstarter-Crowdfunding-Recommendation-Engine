# Kickstarter-Crowdfunding-Recommendation-Engine

Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects. Everything from film, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative projects that are brought to life through the direct support of others. 

The aim of this project was to predict the success or failure of a Kickstarter campaign at launch time. Following steps were performed:
  1. Pre-processing of the data set from Kickstarter 
  2. Exploratory Data Ananlysis (EDA)
  3. Machine Learning Algorithms used:
    <br>1. Random Forest
    <br>2. Logistic Regression
    <br>3. k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)

Conclusion:
With an accuracy of 81%, I was able to predicted the status of the project using Random Forest. I also provided recommendation engine to projects classified as “failed” to increase their chances of being classified as “successful”. This analysis can give prediction regarding success or failure of a particular crowdfunding of a project. By changing parameters of the crowdfunding, the possibility of success can be increased. Update, goal, duration and city were the most important features for the classification models. Maximum Successful projects were carried out in category dance, theater and music. Projects having a average goal between $5000 to $10000 have high chances of becoming successful. Projects providing regular updates have better chances of becoming successful. Successful projects are generally completed in around 38 days.

Final Thoughts:
If crowdfunding is successful in initial stages of project then I can give a great push in the project growth. So these predictions are very helpful to the people who want to convert their imagination into reality with the use of crowdfunding.
